# New Enhancements (March 2025)

## Rating-Based Recommendations
Added functionality to consider both similarity scores and user ratings when recommending movies.

### Changes Made:
1. Modified `get_similar_movies` method to include rating-based ranking
2. Added `use_ratings` parameter to control rating influence
3. Implemented combined scoring system:
   - 70% weight on similarity score
   - 30% weight on user rating
4. Added rating display in output format

### Usage:
```python
recommender = MovieRecommender('processed_data.pkl')
exact_matches, similar_movies = recommender.recommend_movies(
    "Inception",
    use_ratings=True
)
```

## Keyword-Based Search
Added new functionality for searching movies using multiple keywords.

### New Features:
1. Added `keyword_search` method for multi-keyword search
2. Created combined search index including:
   - Movie titles
   - Plot overviews
   - Genres
   - Directors
   - Cast members
3. Implemented keyword scoring system
4. Added rating-based secondary sorting

### Usage:
```python
# Search using multiple keywords
results = recommender.keyword_search("Christopher Nolan action sci-fi")
```

### Search Capabilities:
- Actor names
- Director names
- Genres
- Plot keywords
- Movie titles
- Any combination of the above

### Example Queries:
```
"Christopher Nolan action"
"Leonardo DiCaprio thriller"
"Sci-fi time travel"
"Action adventure 2020"
```

## Output Format Updates
Enhanced the output format to include:
1. User ratings (out of 10)
2. Similarity scores
3. Combined scores (when using ratings)
4. Keyword match scores (for keyword searches)

## Technical Details
1. **Rating Integration**:
   - Ratings are normalized to 0-1 scale
   - Combined with similarity scores using weighted average
   - Results are sorted by combined score

2. **Keyword Search**:
   - Case-insensitive matching
   - Partial word matching
   - Multiple keyword support
   - Relevance scoring based on keyword matches

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Search index created at initialization
   - Efficient string matching using pandas
   - Optimized sorting and filtering

## Future Improvements
1. Add support for:
   - Fuzzy matching for keywords
   - Advanced filtering options
   - Custom weighting for different factors
2. Implement caching for frequently searched terms
3. Add support for more metadata fields
4. Enhance keyword relevance scoring 

# New Enhancements (April 2025)

## Data Structure Changes
- Switched from list-based structure to pandas DataFrame for more efficient data handling
- Added proper data filtering to remove movies with zero ratings and invalid entries
- Implemented more robust error handling throughout the system

## Search Improvements

### Title Search Enhancement
- Added keyword-based matching to find related movies
- Implemented two-step search: exact match followed by keyword matching
- Added filtering of common words to improve keyword search relevance
- Improved presentation of search results with consistent formatting

### Director Search Enhancement
- Implemented fuzzy matching for director names
- Added direct name search without requiring phrases like "directed by"
- Improved ranking to show top-rated movies by each director
- Enhanced error handling for director not found cases

### Genre Search Enhancement
- Added proper genre detection and matching
- Implemented rating-based sorting of genre results
- Improved presentation of genre-based recommendations

### Plot-Based Search Enhancement
- Implemented text preprocessing for better matching
- Used SentenceTransformer for semantic understanding
- Added proper similarity score calculation using cosine similarity
- Implemented hybrid ranking combining similarity and ratings

## Search Logic Hierarchical Improvements
- Implemented a priority-based search approach:
  1. First try title matching (exact match followed by keyword search)
  2. If no title match, try director search
  3. If no director match, try genre search
  4. If all else fails, fall back to plot-based search

## Display Improvements
- Added clearer section headers for different types of recommendations
- Improved formatting of movie details in the output
- Added similarity scores to better explain recommendations
- Implemented different display modes for different search types

## Technical Improvements
- Merged all preprocessing steps into a single efficient pipeline
- Added proper data cleaning with stopword removal
- Implemented optimal embedding generation for different search types
- Improved error handling and user feedback throughout the system
- Removed redundant code and cleaned up the codebase

## Data Processing Enhancements
- Created simplified data load process
- Improved movie filtering to focus on high-quality entries
- Added better handling of edge cases in data formats
- Implemented more efficient data storage format
- Enhanced metadata processing for better search capabilities
