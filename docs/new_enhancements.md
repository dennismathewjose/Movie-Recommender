# New Enhancements (March 2024)

## Rating-Based Recommendations
Added functionality to consider both similarity scores and user ratings when recommending movies.

### Changes Made:
1. Modified `get_similar_movies` method to include rating-based ranking
2. Added `use_ratings` parameter to control rating influence
3. Implemented combined scoring system:
   - 70% weight on similarity score
   - 30% weight on user rating
4. Added rating display in output format

### Usage:
```python
recommender = MovieRecommender('processed_data.pkl')
exact_matches, similar_movies = recommender.recommend_movies(
    "Inception",
    use_ratings=True
)
```

## Keyword-Based Search
Added new functionality for searching movies using multiple keywords.

### New Features:
1. Added `keyword_search` method for multi-keyword search
2. Created combined search index including:
   - Movie titles
   - Plot overviews
   - Genres
   - Directors
   - Cast members
3. Implemented keyword scoring system
4. Added rating-based secondary sorting

### Usage:
```python
# Search using multiple keywords
results = recommender.keyword_search("Christopher Nolan action sci-fi")
```

### Search Capabilities:
- Actor names
- Director names
- Genres
- Plot keywords
- Movie titles
- Any combination of the above

### Example Queries:
```
"Christopher Nolan action"

```

## Output Format Updates
Enhanced the output format to include:
1. User ratings (out of 10)
2. Similarity scores
3. Combined scores (when using ratings)
4. Keyword match scores (for keyword searches)

## Technical Details
1. **Rating Integration**:
   - Ratings are normalized to 0-1 scale
   - Combined with similarity scores using weighted average
   - Results are sorted by combined score

2. **Keyword Search**:
   - Case-insensitive matching
   - Partial word matching
   - Multiple keyword support
   - Relevance scoring based on keyword matches

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Search index created at initialization
   - Efficient string matching using pandas
   - Optimized sorting and filtering

## Future Improvements
1. Add support for:
   - Fuzzy matching for keywords
   - Advanced filtering options
   - Custom weighting for different factors
2. Implement caching for frequently searched terms
3. Add support for more metadata fields
4. Enhance keyword relevance scoring
